# AI-Assisted Diagnosis Report

## Patient/Case Information
- **Classification Strategy**: VGG19 + Grad-CAM + RAG
- **Predicted Class**: Malignant
- **Confidence Level**: 98.50%

## Explainable AI (XAI) Findings
The Grad-CAM heatmap analysis indicates:
High activation in the upper-outer quadrant with irregular density patterns.

## Clinical Context (Retrieved via RAG)
Based on the medical knowledge base:
## Classification Overview
Breast lesions are generally classified into two categories:
1. **Benign**: Non-cancerous growths. They are typically well-defined, regular in shape, and do not invade surrounding tissues.
2. **Malignant**: Cancerous growths. They often have irregular borders, may show architectural distortion, and can invade nearby tissue or spread (metastasize).

## Summary and Discussion
The deep learning model classified this image as **Malignant** with 98.50% confidence. 
The Grad-CAM visualization highlights regions of interest that align with common radiographic markers for malignant cases.
